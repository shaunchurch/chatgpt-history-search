## Getting Started

### Downloading ChatGPT History

To download your ChatGPT history:

1. Visit the official OpenAI website and log into your account.
2. Navigate to your profile/settings section.
3. Look for a section named 'Data Export' or 'Download History'.
4. Follow the prompts to download your conversation history from the email they send you.

### Installation on MacOS

Since the app is from an unverified developer (for now), you'll need to follow these steps to install it:

1. **Download the App**:

   - Download the latest version of the app for your OS from the [Releases](https://github.com/shaunchurch/chatgpt-history-search/releases) page.

2. **Allow Installation**:

For macOS:

- Locate the downloaded `.dmg` file in Finder.
- Control-click the app icon, then choose `Open` from the shortcut menu.
- Click `Open`.

3. **Security & Privacy Settings**:
   - If your Mac is set to allow apps only from the App Store, you might see a warning that the app was not downloaded from the App Store.
   - If you see this warning, go to `System Preferences` > `Security & Privacy`, then click `General`.
   - Click the lock and enter your password to make changes.
   - You should see a message about AppName being blocked. Click `Open Anyway` to confirm your intent to open or install the app.
     note: The releases are built here on Github, from the code on Github. The code you see in the repo is the code you run.
